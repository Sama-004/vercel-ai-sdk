## Getting Started

1.  First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
yarn install

yarn dev
# or
pnpm install

pnpm dev
# or
bun install (preferred)

bun dev
```

2.  Follow the .env.example and create a .env.local file

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You might face errors like could not locate the .bindings file. In this case run

```bash
npm rebuild sqlite3
```
